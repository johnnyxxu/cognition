Cognition
=========
My spot on the web.

Currently, there's not much here but a base to work with.

Development Notes
-----------------
Experimental development changes can be made on the `dev` branch and pushed
with empty commits for backup/sync but `master` should have a clean log.
When merging `dev` into `master`, use `git merge --squash` to combine
experimental commits into a single commit.

TODO
----
More documentation!

Should paths like web and routes be hard coded or defined in config?

Using path.join everywhere for paths is not fun, what else could we do?
